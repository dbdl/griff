BK_NAS_SAMBA

This program is written in BASH. Its purpose is to backup
Linux production data on a SAMBA accessible NAS.

== USAGE ==

1. Think about your backup strategy

  Identify directories to be captured by the backup
  process. Define period.

2. Prepare your backup infrastructure

  Create a NAS share. Setup credentials.
  Create the /backup hierarchy:
    /backup
    /backup/nas
    /backup/bsf

3. Check resource files (configuration) for backup

  Credentials: $myres/nas_creds.${A}
  Source list: $myres/${task}.list

4. Invoke backup

  In this example, we've choosen
  backup -A

== SPECS ==

Backup script shall capture a list of directory on the
local system and copy them identically on the backup
media.

A full backup is an unconditional backup of everything
specified in the source list.

An incremental backup shall be performed when needed.
Looking at the previous full backup, the script shall
copy only new data to the backup media.

== IMPLEMENTATION ==

Backup uses a special file-system that is mounted over SAMBA.

This file-system is created & accessed only by the 
bk_nas_samba script through the loop device on Linux.

Backup are stored in separate directories.

When a new backup occurs, it's separated from previous
by creating a new directory with the date in its name
and by copying the tree with hard links.

Each backup is referenced in the INDEX file.

name;date;size;sizeeff

dir = backup directory
name = task name
date = date in %F %T format
size = size in bytes
sizeeff = effective size (counting hard links)

Backup period defines the time window between two
full backups. When the next next full backup occurs
(i.e.) when there are three full backups, we remove
the first one.

Backup are created in each period with the same name
and the date appended.

To be continued.
