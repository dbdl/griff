BK_NAS_SAMBA

This program is written in BASH. Its purpose is to backup
Linux production data on a SAMBA accessible NAS.

Backup in a special filesystem that is mounted over SAMBA.

This filesystem is created & accessed only by the 
bk_nas_samba script through the loop device on Linux.

Backup are stored in separate directories.

When a new backup occurs, it's separated from previous
by creating a new directory with the date in its name
and by copying the tree with hardlinks.

Each backup is referenced in the INDEX file.

name;date;size;sizeeff

name = task name
date = date in %F %T format
size = size in bytes
sizeeff = effective size (counting hardlinks)

Backup period defines the time window between two
full backups. When the next next full backup occurs
(i.e.) when there are three full backups, we remove
the first one.

Backup are created in each period with the same name
and the date appended.

To be continued.
